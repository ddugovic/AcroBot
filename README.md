**[Acrophobia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrophobia_(game))** is an online multiplayer word game. The game was originally conceived by [Andrea Shubert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Jennifer_Shubert), and programmed by Kenrick Mock and Michelle Hoyle in 1995.

Game play
---------

In each round, AcroBot generates a random [acronym](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym). Players compete by racing to create the most coherent or humorous sentence that fits the acronym - in essence, a [backronym](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym). After a set amount of time expires, each player then votes anonymously via the bot for their favorite answer (aside from their own).

Points are awarded for each popular backronym. Bonus points are awarded based on the fastest response. The first player to a set number of points wins the game.
